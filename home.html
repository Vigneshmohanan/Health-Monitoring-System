		<center><h2>ABOUT US</h2></center>
		<center><p class="ab">The reality of modern medicine is that there are many more patients than doctors who are able to help them. The recent pandemic has proven that the world isn’t ready for emergencies of that sort and that there is a global need for qualified doctors. HMS technology can support the medical staff available and lighten the burden.As for health monitoring, there are two main ways that technology can make doctors more efficient.With HMS, there is no need to process a large amount of data manually. The AI-powered system sends an alarm if the patient’s indicators begin to worsen or if there is a predicted threat that things are becoming dangerous. With the help of HMS systems, doctors can save time and effort.The health monitoring software may also free up more beds in hospitals that can be occupied by patients who need urgent help. After analyzing health indicators with the help of AI, the system may suggest that a certain patient can be discharged and recover at home while receiving medical advice remotely. This allows doctors to focus on people whose lives are in danger.Also, the HMS can help patients recover after surgery or heart attacks while staying home and remaining in touch with a doctor. Even if the patient is your pet.</p></center>
